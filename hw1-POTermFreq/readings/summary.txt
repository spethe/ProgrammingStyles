	    Review of "On Computable numbers with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem"

	This complex paper by Alan Turing was published in the 1930s which is regarded as the base paper for modern day computers.This paper has its basics in mathematics and it starts with 'computable numbers' which are numbers whose decimal can be computed in finite time. Then, computing machines come into the picture by Turing suggesting a simple prototype of a machine having finite configurations. Also the machine provides a tape that is divided into squares holding symbols associated with certian rules.In the paper, to describe the machine execution, Turing uses a table format that defines the m-configuration and the other columns consist of the symbol read from the tape and as a result which configuration should the machine go to. Further, Turing proposes to enumerate these computable sequences, which can be used to give a definite input. The universal computing machine is a machine that can compute any computable sequence given a standard description of machine or an input.By help of this universal machine, Turing attempts to solve the Eintscheidungsproblem. The Eintscheidungsproblem takes a first order logic as an input and requires a binary output of Yes or No. Turing concludes that solving this problem for the general case is not possible.
	The main point of this paper is the formulation of a universal machine that takes enumerable input sequences and performs operations to get the desired output.This makes me go back to the example chosen by Prof Lopes in the class; that of the 'Successor' program which can be solved using the Turing Machine by performing basic operations defined on the machine.Hence, Turing is credited to have established an automatic, universal machine that can solve a human solvable problem using simple rules.
